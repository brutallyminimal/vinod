# 👋🏽 Hello, I'm Vinod.
I’m a seasoned Product Designer who loves to experiment with code. I am simplifying people's lives through design and code since 2009. I believe good design is — simple, honest, focuses on functionality and solves a problem for fellow humans. Empathy is my tool of choice to understand this complicated world. I'm currently looking for exciting full-time opportunities in Berlin.
